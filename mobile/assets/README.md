To add the Google logo for the sign-in button:

1. Download the official Google logo from:
   https://developers.google.com/identity/branding-guidelines

2. Save it as: google_logo.png in this directory

3. Or use any Google logo PNG image (recommended size: 24x24 or 48x48)

For now, the app will show a fallback icon (G icon) if this file is missing.
